#in this section, I will explain about the operators that i'll use in my codes

#Addition -> a + b
#Subtraction -> a - b
#Multiplication -> a * b
#Division -> a / b
#Exponenciation -> a ** b
#Module -> a % b
#int part of division -> a // b

#+= is an operator that make this operation: a = a + b => a += b , you can replace + with any other operator mentioned bellow

#comparasion operators:
#returns a true of false value about a comparasion of two numbers
#Equal -> a == b
#Greater -> a > b
#Less -> a < b
#Not -> a != b
#Greater or equal -> a >= b
#Less or equal -> a <= b

#Logic operator also return true or false values, but bettwen boolean values:
#and -> a and b
#or -> a or b
#not -> not(a)

#Bitwise operator return a number before made a logic comperation of bits of a number:
#For exemple, look: a = 1 & 0 => a = 01 & 00 = 00 (making a logic comparation of all bits of numbers) or, another exemple, b = 2 & 1 = 10 & 01 = 00
#& -> a & b (compare all bits of a and b and return a number (in binary))
#| -> a | b (or)
#^ -> a ^ b (XOR)
#~ -> ~a (NOT)
